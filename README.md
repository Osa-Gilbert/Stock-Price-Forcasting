Abstract

Stock price forecasting plays an important role in financial decision-making and risk management. This thesis aims to perform a comparative analysis between two statistical methods, ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) and Prophet, and two machine learning methods, Random Forest (RF) and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), in the context of stock price forecasting. The study examines their effectiveness, accuracy, and suitability for capturing the complex dynamics of the stock markets to determine which has the best performance when predicting future prices in the stock market. Two stock data (UNILEVER AND GLAXOSMITHKLINE) listed in the London Stock Exchange were used in the study. After analysis, RF emerged as the champion model for the GlaxoSmithKline stock data and XGBOOST was the champion model for the UNILEVER stock.
